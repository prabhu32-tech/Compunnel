        <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
        <p>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</p> <p>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, </p><p>a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, <p>from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections </p><p>1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</p><p> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",</p> <p>comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

            <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.</p> <p>Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, </p><p>accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

         <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
         <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,</p>
         <p>r randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,</p>
